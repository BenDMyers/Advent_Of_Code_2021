# [Day 2](https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/2)

A pretty common staple for Advent of Code is what I might call the direction-and-distance instruction puzzle, where each line contains a direction to go and distance to go in that direction.

This time, commands were `forward`, `up`, and `down`, each followed by a number. See [the puzzle](https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/2) for the specifics on how these commands were used in both parts.

For direction-and-distance puzzles, the key is in interpreting each instructionâ€¦ and this remains fairly constant from year to year. The solution pattern that seems to work best for me is to first **munge the input instructions** into their respective parts, and then to iterate over them and **use a `switch` statement** to handle each direction separately.

## Munging the Input Instructions

Each line in the input file is an instruction, and each instruction contains a *direction* followed by a *number*.

For each line in the file, I follow these steps:

* Split the line up by spaces, so that `'forward 8'` becomes `['forward', '8']`
* Convert the second element of the array, which is the amount, into a number type
* Return a new array which contains the first word and the newly-number-typed amount: `['forward', 8]`

That munging in practice looks like:

```js
const lines = fs
	.readFileSync(`${__dirname}/.input`, 'utf-8')
	.split('\n')
	.map(line => {
		const [direction, amountString] = line.split(' ');
		const amount = Number(amountString);
		return [direction, amount];
	});
```

This munging means that as I work with this data throughout the rest of my code, it's as easy to work with as possible.

```js
[
	['forward', 8],
	['down', 9],
	['up', 4]
]
```

## Following Directions

With each line now split into its direction and its distance, it's time to follow each instruction. For me, this formula has three parts:

1. Establish global variables for your progress in each relevant direction.
2. Create a `for`-loop which iterates all of the munged input instructions.
3. Inside that `for`-loop, process the *direction* using a `switch` statement, where each possible direction type is its own `case`.

In this case, that looked like:

```js
// Establish global progress variables
let horizontalPosition = 0;
let depth = 0;

// Iterate over munged instructions
for (const step of lines) {
	const [direction, amount] = step;

	// Process each possible direction as a case in a `switch` statement
	switch (direction) {
		case 'forward':
			horizontalPosition += amount;
			break;
		case 'down':
			depth += amount;
			break;
		case 'up':
			depth -= amount;
			break;
	}
}

console.log(horizontalPosition * depth);
```

This formula tends to be pretty handy to keep in mind for solving Advent of Code problems.
